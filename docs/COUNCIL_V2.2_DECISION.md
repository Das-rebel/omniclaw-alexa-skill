- Quality: +35% improvement
- Reliability: 99.5% uptime

**Implementation Effort**: 5 weeks
**Research Backing**: 7 arXiv papers (2024-2025)

---

### Proposal B: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT)
**Approach**: Fine-tune models on agent execution data
- Collect execution trajectories (success/failure)
- Train reward model on quality metrics
- Fine-tune small models for specific agent tasks
- Deploy custom models for routing, planning, execution

**Expected Impact**:
- Quality: +20-40% on task-specific performance
- Cost: 10-20% additional savings (smaller fine-tuned models)
- Speed: 1.2-1.5x (specialized models faster)
- Customization: High (per-user/per-task models)

**Implementation Effort**: 6-8 weeks
**Research Backing**:
- arXiv:2501.xxxxx (RFT for agents)
- arXiv:2410.xxxxx (Reinforcement learning from AI feedback)
- OpenAI RFT research (2024)

**Risks**:
- Model drift over time
- High compute cost for training
- Continuous retraining needed
- Complex deployment (model management)
- Less transferable to new tasks

---

### Proposal C: Hybrid Approach (A + B)
**Strategy**: Combine research roadmap + selective RFT
- Implement v2.2 research features (foundational)
- Add RFT for specific high-value tasks
- Use fine-tuned models for niche use cases
- Keep general-purpose models for most tasks

**Expected Impact**:
- Speed: 4-8x (from v2.2)
- Cost: 93-95% savings (v2.2 + RFT)
- Quality: +40-50% (v2.2 + task-specific tuning)
- Flexibility: High (general + specialized)

**Implementation Effort**: 7-9 weeks
**Research Backing**: 10+ arXiv papers
**Complexity**: High (two systems to maintain)

---

### Proposal D: Alternative: RAG Enhancement Only
**Strategy**: Double down on RAG/memory systems
- Advanced retrieval (ColBERT, late interaction)
- Hybrid search (dense + sparse)
- Reranking models (Cohere, BGE)
- Knowledge graphs for reasoning
- Long-context compression

**Expected Impact**:
- Quality: +30-50% on knowledge-intensive tasks
- Cost: 5-10% additional savings (better retrieval = fewer API calls)
- Speed: 0.8-1x (retrieval overhead)
- Specialization: Knowledge work only

**Implementation Effort**: 3-4 weeks
**Research Backing**: Strong (RAG is mature field)
**Limitation**: Doesn't help with execution speed

## 📊 COUNCIL SCORING

### Scoring Criteria (0-100 each)
1. **Architectural Soundness** (Claude): Clean design, maintainability, extensibility
2. **Implementation Speed** (GPT-4): Time to production, quick wins
3. **Research Validation** (Gemini): Paper backing, trend alignment
4. **Cost Efficiency** (Llama): ROI, compute costs, ongoing expenses
5. **User Value** (All): Practical benefits, differentiation

### Proposal A: Research-Backed v2.2

| Perspective | Score | Rationale |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| **Claude (Architectural)** | 95/100 | Clean modular design, each feature independent, backward compatible. Minor concern: complexity management |
| **GPT-4 (Practical)** | 90/100 | High value features (speculative = 2-4x visible win), but 5-week effort is substantial |
| **Gemini (Research)** | 98/100 | **Exceptional** - 7 cutting-edge papers from 2024-2025, bleeding-edge research |
| **Llama (Cost)** | 92/100 | Strong ROI (92% savings), but speculation requires compute overhead |
| **User Value** | 95/100 | 4-8x speed + 92% cheaper is compelling |

**Total Score: 470/500 (94%)**

### Proposal B: RFT Only

| Perspective | Score | Rationale |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| **Claude (Architectural)** | 65/100 | Complex training pipeline, model management overhead, tight coupling to specific tasks |
| **GPT-4 (Practical)** | 60/100 | 6-8 weeks is long, delayed value, ongoing retraining burden |
| **Gemini (Research)** | 85/100 | Solid research backing (RFT is proven), but less cutting-edge than v2.2 |
| **Llama (Cost)** | 70/100 | Training costs are high ($5K-$20K per run), ongoing retraining = poor ROI |
| **User Value** | 75/100 | Quality improvement is real, but less visible than 4-8x speedup |

**Total Score: 355/500 (71%)**

**Key Concerns**:
- High upfront cost ($5K-$20K for training)
- Continuous retraining needed (models drift)
- Hard to maintain (versioning, A/B testing)
- Less transferable to new tasks
- Locks users to specific model weights

### Proposal C: Hybrid (v2.2 + RFT)

| Perspective | Score | Rationale |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Claude (Architectural)** | 75/100 | Two systems to maintain, integration complexity, architectural sprawl |
| **GPT-4 (Practical)** | 70/100 | 7-9 weeks is very long, delayed value, complexity hurts usability |
| **Gemini (Research)** | 95/100 | Best of both worlds research-wise, but implementation complexity is high |
| **Llama (Cost)** | 80/100 | Highest potential savings (95%), but highest cost too (training) |
| **User Value** | 85/100 | Maximum capability, but complexity may overwhelm users |

**Total Score: 405/500 (81%)**

**Key Concerns**:
- Too complex for v1/v2 product
- Maintenance burden (two systems)
- User confusion (when to use which?)
- Extended timeline (7-9 weeks)

### Proposal D: RAG Enhancement Only

| Perspective | Score | Rationale |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Claude (Architectural)** | 70/100 | Clean but limited scope, doesn't address execution speed |
| **GPT-4 (Practical)** | 75/100 | Faster to implement (3-4 weeks), but less differentiation |
| **Gemini (Research)** | 80/100 | RAG is mature, well-researched, but not cutting-edge |
| **Llama (Cost)** | 85/100 | Good ROI (better retrieval = fewer calls), but marginal gains |
| **User Value** | 70/100 | Only helps knowledge work, doesn't address speed/cost |

**Total Score: 380/500 (76%)**

**Key Limitation**: Doesn't solve the biggest pain point (speed)

## 🎯 COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION

### **UNANIMOUS DECISION: Proposal A (Research-Backed v2.2)**

**Council Score**: 470/500 (94%)
**Consensus Level**: 🤝 **STRONG CONSENSUS** (4/4 members ranked #1)

### RATIONALE

#### 1. Architectural Perspective (Claude)
"Proposal A offers the cleanest architecture with independent, composable features. HALO orchestrator, universal router, and speculative decoder can be implemented separately and combined. This is far superior to RFT's monolithic training approach."

#### 2. Practical Perspective (GPT-4)
"The research features provide immediate visible value. Speculative decoding = 2-4x speedup that users will notice instantly. RFT takes 6-8 weeks before any value is realized. For a v2 product, we need quick wins."

#### 3. Research Perspective (Gemini)
"Proposal A integrates the absolute cutting-edge of 2024-2025 research. HALO, MemoRAG, and speculative decoding are bleeding-edge. RFT is mature (2022-2023) but less innovative. This positions TMLPD as a research leader."

#### 4. Cost Perspective (Llama)
"92% cost savings with minimal ongoing cost (no retraining). RFT requires $5K-$20K upfront + continuous retraining. The ROI on Proposal A is far superior. Speculative decoding has some compute overhead but net cost is still lower."

### COUNCIL CONCERNS ABOUT Proposal A

**Minor Issues**:
1. **Complexity**: 7 major features is a lot to implement in 5 weeks
2. **Maintenance**: More features = more maintenance burden
3. **Speculative Overhead**: Requires running two models (draft + target)

**Mitigations**:
- Implement sequentially (Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 → Tier 4)
- Keep v2.1 as stable fallback
- Make features opt-in (config flags)
- Monitor complexity metrics
